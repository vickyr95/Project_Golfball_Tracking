# Project Virtual Golf Scoring Game

**About**

Virtual Golf Scoring Game is an innovative golf simulation project aimed at creating an immersive and authentic golfing experience. The project uses advanced computer vision techniques and custom hardware to monitor real-time ball parameters like speed and direction, replicating the dynamics of a golf game on-screen.

**Our Work**

We designed the simulation using OpenCV for precise ball detection and speed calculation. A custom handheld device (ESP32 IMU-based), worn by the player, transmits hitting times to the system. This setup ensures accurate feedback and an engaging experience that mirrors the actual dynamics of playing golf.

The project was developed using a combination of technologies, including Stereo Vision, OpenCV, ESP32, Jetson, and Python. By optimizing Bluetooth communication methods, we achieved a performance frame rate of 20-25 FPS, significantly enhancing the user experience. Users can now access precise tracking data and performance metrics through a user-friendly interface.
